Version: 0.2.0
Date: TDB
  Info:
    - This is a bigger update, with new features, balancing and quality of life changes from hours of play testing.
    - Added three new researches: Acceleration Train Powerpack, Speed Train Powerpack and Efficiency Train Powerpack.
    - Each research unlocks a new experimental powerpack that has its own unique properties. They can be charged at the experimental charging station and refurbished at a chemical plant.
    - As a result of this, you can now select the recipes in Experimental Train Powerpack Charging Stations. (Your old stations will still work, and you won't need to select the recipe again)
  Features:
    - Speed Train Powerpack: This powerpack has a higher top speed than the regular powerpack, but has a lower acceleration and fuel efficiency.
    - Acceleration Train Powerpack: This powerpack has a higher acceleration than the regular powerpack, but has a lower top speed and fuel efficiency.
    - Efficiency Train Powerpack: This powerpack has a higher fuel efficiency than the regular powerpack, and no other downsides.
    - New icons for the experimental powerpacks, you can differentiate them by their a subtle colour change in the icon respective to the module they take. Yep, that's right. Each powerpack takes a tier 3 module to craft, making them quite expensive. This is to balance the huge benefits they can present.
  Quality of Life:
    - Electric Locomotives now have three output slots, to avoid "No burnt result space" messages stopping your trains during a phased powerpack changeover, or running your network on a mix of powerpacks.
    - You can now manually select the recipes to be completed by charging stations. (Please submit a FAQ if you want the icon to display over the building in alt mode, I am still undecided on this)
    - Better ordering of menu items.
  Balancing:
    - Increased crafting time of all Powerpack charging stations.
    - Increased destroyed powerpack refurbishment time.
    - Halved the default powerpack fuel value.
    - All spent fuel items have a max stack of 20, due to the QOL change above.
    - You no longer need to research space science to unlock experimental charging stations, but you do have to research Electric Wagon Locomotive.

Version: 0.1.4
Date: 09. 01. 2024
  Info:
    - Updated changelog to work with Factorio's parser.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.1.3
Date: 09. 01. 2024
  Info:
    - Added the Electric Wagon Locomotive.
  Features:
    - Introduces the Electric Wagon Locomotive. This is the same as the Electric Locomotive, but with the visual properties of a wagon. This helps the aesthetics of longer train configurations such as 2-8. This can be unlocked after researching the Electric Wagon Locomotive research.
  Balancing:
    - Battery refurbishment is now a little more expensive, although no ingredients have changed.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.1.2
Date: 07. 01. 2024
  Info:
    - Added Experimental Train Powerpack Charging Stations. (New research)
    - A new "Faster Train Powerpack Charging" recipe for the experimental charging station.
  Features:
    - New building and recipe icons for the experimental charging station.
  Balancing:
    - All researches have sensible prerequisites and required science cost.
    - Experimental charging stations use a lot more power than regular charging stations.
    - Longer powerpack charge times.

Version: 0.1.1
Date: 06. 01. 2024
  Info:
    - Initial release
    - Forked from se-space-trains
  Features:
    - Rebranded research and added new infinite research.
    - Renamed all new entities and items.
    - New MiniMap icons for electric trains.
  Balancing:
    - Expensive, late game recipes for electric trains.
    - Train physics are realistic for vanilla.
