[entity-description]
space-locomotive=Electric powered locomotive that uses small 50MJ Train Powerpacks. This locomotive is designed to operate with an increased acceleration and top speed than the standard locomotive.
space-cargo-wagon=Extended capacity cargo wagon compatible with the Electric Locomotive. This wagon use MAGLEV and passive conductivity technology to negate the effects of resistive forces.
space-fluid-wagon=Extended capacity fluid wagon compatible with the Electric Locomotive. This wagon use MAGLEV and passive conductivity technology to negate the effects of resistive forces.
space-train-battery-charging-station=A station to recharge depleted Electric Train Power Packs.
