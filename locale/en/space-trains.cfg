[entity-description]
space-locomotive=Electric powered locomotive that uses small 50MJ Train Powerpacks. This locomotive is designed to operate with an increased acceleration and top speed than the standard locomotive.
space-cargo-wagon=Extended capacity cargo wagon compatible with the Electric Locomotive. This wagon use MAGLEV and passive conductivity technology to negate the effects of resistive forces.
space-fluid-wagon=Extended capacity fluid wagon compatible with the Electric Locomotive. This wagon use MAGLEV and passive conductivity technology to negate the effects of resistive forces.
space-train-battery-charging-station=A station to recharge depleted Electric Train Power Packs.
experimental-space-train-battery-charging-station=An experimental station to recharge depleted Electric Train Power Packs. This new station works at 3x the speed of the standard charging station.

[technology-description]
tech-space-trains=Specially designed trains that use Electric Powerpacks instead of fuel.
tech-space-trains-braking-force=From the continued testing and research of Electric Trains, the braking force of the Electric and Non-Electric Trains can be increased by 5%.
tech-space-trains-experimental-charging=From the continued testing and research of Electric Trains, a new experimental charging station has been developed that can charge Electric Train Powerpacks at 3x the speed of the standard charging station. There is, however, a 10% chance that the Powerpack will be destroyed during the charging process.
