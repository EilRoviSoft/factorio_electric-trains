# Version: 0.1.2 - 07.01.2024

- Added Experimental Train Powerpack Charging Stations. (New research)
- A new "Faster Train Powerpack Charging" recipe for the experimental charging station.

### Some balance changes

- All researches have sensible prerequisites and required science cost.
- Experimental charging stations use a lot more power than regular charging stations.
- Longer powerpack charge times.

### Bug fixes

# Version: 0.1.3 - 08.01.2024

- Added the Electric Locomotive Wagon (Same as the Electric Locomotive, but with the visual properties of a wagon). This helps the aesthetics of longer train configurations such as 2-8. This can be unlocked after researching the Electric Locomotive Wagon research.

### Some balance changes
